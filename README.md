# Sklearn Pipeline Tutorial

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook provides a quick tutorial on using the scikit-learn library for machine learning in Python. It uniquely combines discussions on the impact of hardware, specifically processing cores, with practical machine learning applications. Key sections include:

1. **Chat GPT**: An introduction to the Chat GPT concept, setting the stage for the tutorial.
2. **Why Cores Matter**: This section shows the significance of processing cores in machine learning, providing insights into computational efficiency and performance.  A comparative study on the performance and implications of using 10 and 40 processing cores in machine learning tasks.
3. **Predictions**: Focused on making predictions using machine learning models, this section offers hands-on examples and discusses various techniques and methodologies.
4. **Scoring**: A quick looking into one way to  evaluate these machine learning pipelines

## Prerequisites
To get the most out of this tutorial, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- An understanding of fundamental machine learning concepts.
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
